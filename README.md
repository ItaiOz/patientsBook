This is a Full Stack site I wrote to handle an amount of data and make changes in patients examinations.

The Program uses Node.js as a backend server and React framework as Frontend. DB is handled via Mongo DB.

Installation:

1 - Clone repository <br>
2 - On terminal, open project's direcory and run npm / yarn install <br>
3 - Type in "npm run start_full_app" to run both server and client apps

Start going through patients data & feel free to manipulate info
